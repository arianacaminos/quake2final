How to install and play my mod.


My mod is a knockoff version of Call of Duty Gun Game. You will start with the blaster and then once you kill an enemy move onto the next gun. Once you get through all of the 
guns without dying you win and the game will end. If you die you will start over at the beginning. Watch out because the enemies movements and helath are enhanced. 

My Deliverables:
-The game ends when you go through all the guns and kill one player with each gun 
-The player switches through 5 different guns 
-Enemies are spawned in with each gun change
-Enemies health are enhanced and movements are made quicker 
-2 customized powerups placed in the map 

Common Deliverables:
-Shortcut that Auto-Launches your Mod
-Mod in a Separate Folder
-README file in GIT that explains HOWTO install and play / test your mod
-UI updates reflecting your Personal Deliverables
-Help Screen to detail how to play your mod in game


One way to install and play the mod is to first download the file onto your computer. You also will want to buy quake 2 and then find the folder on your computer. 
Once you have done that you can create a shortcut of quake 2 in that file and right click on it and go to properties. Then in the target section at the end add +set game
happiestmod. Once you have done that you just run that shortcut and will be able to access my mod and play it wheneve you like.
